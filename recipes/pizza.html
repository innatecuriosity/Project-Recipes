    <h1>Pizza</h1>
    <!-- Dish intro -->
    <p>We all know it, one of the most iconic dishes in modern culture. A piece of flatbread, usually circular, with various toppings, that should at least include cheese and tomato sauce. It's not really healthy on a phyisical level, but can do wonders for our mental health. And as I heard from a neuroscientist once (no joke) <i>"One has to decide every now and then, do I want to be healthy, or do I want to be happy"</i></p>
